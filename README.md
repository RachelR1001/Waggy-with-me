# Waggy-with-me
An interactive and intelligent design project for Future Innovative Cockpit. As Gen Z increasingly views pets as family members and friends, there is a growing trend of pet owners embarking on road trips with their furry companions. Recognizing this, our project aims to design an AI-empowered pet-friendly intelligent cockpit that enhances the travel experience for both humans and pets. Our focus is on meeting the unique needs of Gen Z pet owners by integrating advanced AI technology into the vehicle's cockpit to ensure safety, comfort, and convenience during trips.

## Introduction
**1. Background** 
Nowadays, the lifestyle and values of Generation Z have undergone significant changes. One of the most notable shifts is the decline in birth rates and the substantial increase in pet ownership. Compared with the previous superior-subordinate relationship, Gen Z now pursues equality with pets. Therefore, it is a trend to create a city where people and pets coexist equally.

As the primary car buyers of the future, Generation Z pet owners are increasingly inclined to travel with their pets. Consequently, the car has become a new setting for nurturing the human-pet relationship. While many in-car products are designed for pets, they often focus on restricting pet movement within the vehicle, neglecting emotional care and natural needs. Therefore, we aim to, on the basis of meeting human needs, incorporate the perspective of pets. By leveraging AI technology and innovating travel methods, we seek to transform the car into an emotional bond between humans and their pets, creating an environment where Gen Z and pets can coexist equally and harmoniously.

**2. Design & Prototype**
Our design project practice is divided into two main parts: conceptual cockpit design and the definition of AI-empowered innovative features. The conceptual cockpit design primarily showcases our vision for a pet-friendly future cockpit. The AI-empowered key functions are divided into three main categories: Intelligent Scene Recommendation, Active Multimodal Perception and Reasoning, and Passive Full-time Monitoringã€‚
